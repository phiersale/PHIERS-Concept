    <p>The founder's truth. The institutional resistance. The proof behind PHIERS.</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>What You Need to Know First</h2>
    <div class="subtle-box">
    <p>
        PHIERS is a citizen-powered healthcare movement built by Foundational Black American men — with the math to fix what Congress has failed to fix for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
        One conversion from a $10,000 insurance plan to a $600 telehealth plan frees enough savings to fund 12 more people. Those 12 fund 148. Those 148 fund 1,825. At 3.5% of the country — just 11.6 million people — the cascade becomes self-sustaining. Telehealth becomes free. Monthly relief checks follow. Jobs follow.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not ideology. This is arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the people who built it were never supposed to build anything this powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page is the record of what it cost — and why it exists anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not a complaint. Not a performance. Not a reaction.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">
        A record.
    </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="dark">
    <h2>The Validation They Gave Before They Knew the Full Story</h2>
    <div class="quote-block">
        <p>"If we're talking to you right now, there is an available editorial window."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote-block">
        <p>"If you weren't legit, we wouldn't risk putting our name behind yours."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote-block">
        <p>"Major outlets are interested — Forbes, USA Today, International Business Times."</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A Fortune 500 PR firm reviewed PHIERS and staked their reputation on it. Their assessment was unambiguous: the math was sound, the architecture was solid, and the national implications were undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing about PHIERS changed after that review. The math didn't change. The architecture didn't change. The national impact didn't change.
    </p>
    <p>
        What changed was their understanding of the founder — and the establishment's discomfort with a Black American innovator outperforming long‑standing institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only thing that shifted was the understanding of who built it — and what it was built to disrupt.
    </p>

    <h2>The Founder's Story They Didn't Expect</h2>
    <div class="image-block">
        <img src="Me_n_%20Dad_at_CHURCH.png" alt="A moment of strength and brotherhood" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="width:140px; max-width:140px; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto; cursor:pointer; border-radius:6px; box-shadow:0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);">
        <div class="image-caption">A moment of strength, support, and brotherhood.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        PHIERS was built by someone who refused to surrender integrity — even when it cost stability, safety, and everything the establishment assumed he depended on.
    </p>
    <p>
        PHIERS was built under conditions most people would not choose — and many would not survive.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was not built with institutional protection. It was not built with corporate backing. It was not built with political shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was built because it needed to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it was built by a Foundational Black American dad and son who refused to shrink when powerful systems expected them to.

    <h2>What PHIERS Disrupts</h2>

    </div>

    <p>
        PHIERS lowers costs. It removes unnecessary middlemen. It simplifies systems that have grown complicated on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        When something reduces waste and returns power to the people, the systems that profit from confusion rarely celebrate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hospital networks. Insurance companies. Gatekeepers. Corporate middle structures built to extract value without creating it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When control is threatened, pressure follows.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is not emotion. That is how power behaves.

    <p>Not for symbolism. For necessity.</p>

        When you build a model that undercuts the corporate supply chain, challenges conventional power, and empowers communities at scale — resistance is inevitable.

        Yet PHIERS exists because the founders — all FBA men, dads, sons, brothers, uncles, nephews, friends, and allies — refused to break as a people.

    <p>This is not a story of victimhood.</p>
    <p>It is a record of endurance.</p>

    <p>
        PHIERS was created by us as a gift of light and love for humanity. A solution to some of the biggest challenges facing the world. And it was built under conditions designed to stop it — by FBA men who refused to be stopped.

        We have been sabotaged. Betrayed. Disrupted. Blacklisted. Homeless. Erased.
    </p>

        And we persist — because when the world finally understands the truth about who we are and what we have to offer, it will be a better place.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is the only reason we talk about race. Not to divide. Not to antagonize. But because we are dismissed — until we do something so exceptional and so differentiated that it becomes impossible to ignore.

    <p>
        That is exactly what PHIERS was designed to do.

    <h2>The Moment That Proves the Point: BAFTA 2026</h2>

    </div>

    <p>
        On February 22, 2026, Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo — two of the most accomplished Black actors of their generation — stood on the BAFTA stage in London and had the N-word shouted at them. Twice. Three times according to witnesses in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
        BAFTA had a tape delay. The BBC had editors. Warner Bros. immediately contacted BAFTA and requested the slur be removed from the broadcast. It was not removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        What was removed? A joke about "corrupt leaders." A filmmaker saying "Free Palestine." Political speech was muted. The racial slur directed at two Black men was not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterward, Delroy Lindo said he and Jordan "did what we had to do" — and that he wished "someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
        No one did. Not at first.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the world we live in. These are two men who carried a film called <em>Sinners</em> — a film about survival, resistance, and Black identity — onto the world stage. And the world stage could not protect their dignity for two hours.
    </p>

        Journalist Jemele Hill said it plainly: the expectation is that Black people "are just supposed to be ok with being disrespected and dehumanized so that other people don't feel bad."

    <h2>Why This Connects to PHIERS</h2>
    <p>
        PHIERS was reviewed and blessed by a Fortune 500 PR firm. The math was sound. The architecture was solid. The national implications were undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then — once they understood who built it and what it was truly designed to disrupt — the distance began.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same pattern. Different institution. Same message:
        <em>We will celebrate you up to the point where your excellence threatens our comfort.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        What PHIERS threatens is the notion that FBA men are inferior — that we don't have the capacity to engineer solutions that outperform anything the establishment has to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do. And PHIERS is the proof.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight" style="background: rgba(245,200,66,0.08); border-color: #f5c842;">
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0; color: #f5c842;">
            "The only thing that shifted was the understanding of who built it —<br>
            and what it was built to disrupt:<br>
            the notion that FBA men are inferior to our counterparts."
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #ccc; margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">— Will Price, PHIERS Founders</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        We don't talk about race to be divisive. We talk about it because it is used to denigrate and disrespect us. And we respond — constructively, mathematically, permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
        PHIERS improves the lives of everyone else more than they can improve ours without us.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        So we need each other. And that is our message of hope — despite all the dirt done to destroy us.

    <h2>Our Ask to Michael and Delroy</h2>

    <div class="img-block">
        <img src="Michael_B_jordan_and_Delroy_Lindo_DIGNIFIED.jfif"
             class="img-thumb"
             alt="Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo — dignity and presence"
             onclick="openModal(this.src)">
        <p class="img-caption">Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo — two men who carried a movement with grace under fire.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Michael B. Jordan. Delroy Lindo.
    </p>
    <p>
        You stood on that stage with dignity under conditions no man should have to endure in 2026. You did what you had to do. The world watched. And then — no one from BAFTA came to find you.
    </p>
    <p>
        That silence is the pattern. Not an accident. Not an oversight. A pattern — the same one that plays out every time a Black man builds something real, stands somewhere prestigious, or refuses to shrink on cue. The institution that invited you in cannot figure out how to protect you once you're there.
    </p>
    <p>
        PHIERS was built inside that same pattern. Blessed by a Fortune 500 PR firm — until they understood who built it and what it was built to disrupt. Then the distance began. Different institution. Same silence.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are not asking for validation. We already have the math. We already have the architecture. We already have the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are asking you to be the voice that makes the pattern undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your voice, combined with this solution, would force every institution that chose comfort over integrity to reckon publicly with what they dismissed. BAFTA. The BBC. Every firm that blessed the work and then backed away from the builder.
    </p>
    <p>
        They would have to watch a Black-built solution — engineered by FBA men, carried by two of the most respected Black men in film — get covered in Forbes, USA Today, and the International Business Times.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8px;">
            They will understand what they dismissed.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">
            And the world will be better for it —<br>
            not despite who built this, but <em>because</em> of who built this.

    <h2>What This Means — And Why It Creates Leverage</h2>
    <p>
        This page does not accuse individuals. It documents patterns — patterns that reveal integrity, resilience, and truth. Patterns that funders and institutions cannot ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
        People follow leaders who sacrifice. People trust those who pay a price for what they believe in.
    </p>
    <p>
        PHIERS is designed to change the way the world sees Black men — by solving problems that no one else can compete with or outperform without cheating. By making them justify NOT using our solutions, since they are sustainable, affordable, scalable, and designed to be international.
    </p>
    <p>
        When voices like Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo step forward to represent this solution, institutions like BAFTA and the BBC would have to acknowledge that great things can happen to society — in the UK and here in the US — when solutions built by us are shared with the world.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight" style="background: rgba(245,200,66,0.1); border-color: #f5c842; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0; color: #f5c842;">
            Authenticity. Credibility. Moral authority. The architecture of integrity.<br>
            These are things the establishment cannot buy, copy, or take away.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight" style="background: rgba(76,175,80,0.12); border-color: #4caf50;">
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">
            We improve the lives of everyone else more than they can improve ours without us.<br>
            So we need each other — and that is our message of hope,<br>
            despite everything done to destroy us.

        If not this, what?<br>
        If not now, when?<br>
        If not us, who?
