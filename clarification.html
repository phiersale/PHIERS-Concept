            <p class="date">December 31, 2025 - Full transparency on how our mission has evolved</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- THE MISSION -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Real Mission: Intelligent Glue</h2>
            <p>We are not another healthcare startup. We are not here to compete with ZORTT, Mark Cuban, or anyone else.</p>
            
            <p><span class="emphasis">PHIERS is the "Intelligent Glue"</span> that connects the dots in ways that help every partner and platform we work with do MORE, GROW FASTER, and ACHIEVE BETTER outcomes than they could without us.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>We solve multiple problems for different target audiences simultaneously, with zero wasted motion.</strong></p>
                <p>Healthcare gets affordable. Workers get good jobs. Families get economic security. Democracy gets accountability. Communities get healing. All at the same time. All from one integrated solution.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Everything we build is 100% owned, operated by, and accountable to the masses—not corporations, not shareholders, not us.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Our target audience: Everyone who is tired of Trump's policies hurting America, everyone who knows healthcare is broken, everyone who wants their government back.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We will help our partners grow by tens—even hundreds—of millions.</strong> Not by competing, but by funneling collaborative customers through our cooperative platform. Everyone wins.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- THE 16-YEAR JOURNEY -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why 16 Years? The Real Story</h2>
            
            <h3>The Original Goal (2009)</h3>
            <p>We started with a clear mission: <span class="emphasis">Remove the profit motive from healthcare and undercut the market everywhere possible</span> while fixing our broken healthcare system.</p>
            
            <p>Simple. Dangerous to the pharmaceutical industry. That's when the problems started.</p>
            
            <h3>The Threat Pattern</h3>
            <p>Almost every time we got close to launching—or when a partner realized we were <strong>serious about not chasing money</strong> but instead paving the way to positive outcomes—the same thing happened:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>We were threatened. Sabotaged. Blacklisted. Ran out of town. Or we had to pivot because the threat environment demanded that we solve bigger problems on the horizon first.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>We couldn't turn our attention to healthcare innovation while existential threats loomed. We had to solve those bigger problems first—before we could safely launch the system others could build and be successful with. (Like ZORTT 😉)</p>
            
            <h3>The SureSafe Pivot (2007-2012)</h3>
            <p>In 2007, we designed <strong>SureSafe</strong>—the exact pharmaceutical cost-reduction model that would later become Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs.</p>
            
            <p>But here's what happened: The <span class="emphasis">Panama Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2007</span>, but its implementation wasn't delayed until 2012. This agreement fundamentally altered the market conditions we needed for SureSafe to launch successfully.</p>
            
            <p>By the time 2009 rolled around—when we were ready to launch PHIERS—the trade environment had shifted. We had to pivot. The team dispersed. Everyone did different things. We never resurrected the business.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mark Cuban did, though.</strong> And he did it brilliantly. Cost Plus Drugs works because the core concept was right. We're grateful he had the runway to succeed where we couldn't.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- THE PLATFORM CONCEPT -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Cooperative Platform: Everything App for the People</h2>
            
            <p>We will build our own platform, powered by <strong>thousands of out-of-work open-source developers</strong> who want to build an "everything app"—just like Elon Musk envisioned.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The concept is well-documented in our archives.</strong> We had designs for a connected community platform that would accomplish the same goals Elon mentions today.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The critical difference:</strong> He builds for control and personal gain. We build to protect the collective best interests of humanity.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Our platform will be smaller, smarter, and purpose-built to use shared services that improve the human condition—not extract profit from it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- THE 3.5% LEVERAGE -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The 3.5% Solution: Leverage to Hold Congress Accountable</h2>
            
            <p>Research by Erica Chenoweth (Harvard Kennedy School) analyzed 323 social movements and found one truth:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>When 3.5% of the population is actively organized, systemic change becomes mathematically inevitable.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>That's 11.6 million Americans.</p>
            
            <p>Right now, Congress ignores us because we're fragmented. We're asking for different things. We're not organized.</p>
            
            <p><span class="emphasis">At 3.5% participation, we have leverage.</span> Real leverage. Congress won't be able to ignore 11.6 million organized Americans demanding:</p>
            
            <ul style="color: #c8e6c9; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Affordable healthcare</li>
                <li>Good jobs</li>
                <li>Economic security</li>
                <li>Government accountability</li>
                <li>Democracy that works</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">That's what PHIERS delivers. And that's what gives us the power to hold Congress accountable for different, better decisions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- FOREVER EVOLVING -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>We Are Forever Evolving</h2>
            
            <p>This website will evolve constantly. Not because we're confused or changing direction, but because <span class="emphasis">emerging threats demand that we stay ten steps ahead.</span></p>
            
            <p>We've spent 16 years learning to anticipate threats, pivot when necessary, and keep our eyes on the real prize: a healthcare system, economy, and government that serve people—not profit.</p>
            
            <p>We will continue to do that. Openly. Transparently. Accountably.</p>
