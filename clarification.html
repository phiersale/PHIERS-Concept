            <h2>📢 We've Clarified Our Approach</h2>

        <!-- HISTORY SECTION -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>The History: 16 Years Pioneering Healthcare's Profit-Free Future</h3>
            <div class="history-box">
                <p><strong>Al Wilson and Bill Wiggins founded SureSafe Pharma (2007),</strong> pioneering a revolutionary model: importing medications WITHOUT markups or middlemen. This wasn't theoretical—it proved that eliminating profit from pharmaceutical distribution works at scale.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Why 16 Years?</strong> The journey from 2007 to 2025 wasn't smooth. We faced threats, sabotage, and market disruptions that forced us to pivot. The Panama Free Trade Agreement (signed 2007, implemented 2012) shifted market conditions. We had to pause, reassess, and wait for the right moment. In the meantime, we watched others succeed with our concepts—and we celebrated them. Mark Cuban launched Cost Plus Drugs (2022) with our model. ZORTT Elite Medical created telemedicine marketplaces with cooperative principles. These weren't competitors—they were PROOF our concepts worked.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The "Intelligent Glue" Framing:</strong> PHIERS isn't here to compete with anyone. We're the "Intelligent Glue" that connects the dots. We'll funnel cooperative members to the telemedicine platforms they choose (ZORTT is our validated choice). We'll provide medication access through group purchasing (the SureSafe model). We'll sponsor enrollment, group purchasing power, and community coordination. We make everyone's services work better together—not by replacing them, but by amplifying their reach through cooperative scale.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong> Mark Cuban independently validated our pharmaceutical model when he launched Cost Plus Drugs in 2022—15 years after SureSafe demonstrated it worked. 7 million customers. 80-90% savings. ZORTT Elite Medical validated our telemedicine delivery model. Multiple new companies are building community marketplaces just like we envisioned.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The Bigger Picture:</strong> Over 16 years, we've pioneered these cooperative concepts and published them freely. Multiple sources have now proved they work at scale. We're not upset about that—we're grateful. Now we're channeling this into something bigger: the organizational power to amplify everyone's reach through cooperative scale.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- PREVIOUS FRAMING -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>What We Were Focused On (Prior Art Phase)</h3>
            <p>We were initially focused on demonstrating proof of concept for cooperative healthcare and medication access models. While accurate, this framing missed the bigger picture: the political and organizational power needed to force systemic change.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- NEW FRAMING -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Our New Framing: The 3.5% Cooperative Movement</h3>
            <p><strong>We're building democratic power—a member-owned cooperative that gives We the People leverage to force Congress to act on ALL interconnected crises:</strong></p>
            
            <div class="crises-list">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare access</strong> - Affordable medication and telemedicine for all</li>
                    <li><strong>AI-driven job displacement</strong> - Create 8-14M good jobs in healthcare/wellness</li>
                    <li><strong>Housing affordability</strong> - Healthcare savings fund housing/economic security</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost of living crisis</strong> - Direct savings to people struggling</li>
                    <li><strong>Reversing destructive policies</strong> - Organized constituency demanding better</li>
                    <li><strong>Ending wars</strong> - Redirect military spending to healing</li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong style="color: #81c784; font-size: 1.05em;">WE ARE HERE FOR WE THE PEOPLE.</strong> We invite ALL grassroots organizations, unions, and civic engagement programs to join in solidarity so we can fix our government together.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- WHAT THIS MEANS -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>What This Actually Means</h3>
            <div class="cooperative-box">
                <h4>🔥 The Cooperative Model in Action</h4>
                <p><strong>We're not offering telemedicine yet. We're building the democratic power structure.</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Sponsor everyone's enrollment in the telemedicine program of their choice (ZORTT is our validated choice)</li>
                    <li>Provide medication access through group purchasing on behalf of We the People (SureSafe model at scale)</li>
                    <li>Guarantee the largest discounts because we'll have the most buying power (100M+ members eventually)</li>
                    <li>Pass ALL savings directly to members and CMS to fund Medicare for All with price controls</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>All of this happens once we hit critical mass and are operational.</strong> Right now, we're building the movement.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- 3.5% POWER -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Power of 3.5%: Leverage to Hold Congress Accountable</h3>
            <p>Research by Erica Chenoweth (Harvard Kennedy School) analyzed 323 social movements and found one undeniable truth:</p>
            <div class="cooperative-box">
                <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.1em; color: #ffeb3b; font-weight: bold;">When 3.5% of the population is actively organized, systemic change becomes mathematically inevitable.</p>
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">That's 11.6 million Americans.</p>
            <p>Right now, Congress ignores us because we're fragmented. We're asking for different things. We're not organized.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #ffeb3b; font-weight: bold;">At 3.5% participation, we have leverage.</span> Real leverage. Congress won't be able to ignore 11.6 million organized Americans demanding affordable healthcare, good jobs, economic security, and government accountability.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>We have 100M+ Americans affected by these crises. We exceed the 3.5% threshold by 9x.</strong> That's not pressure. That's inevitability.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Why This Matters: The Real Solution</h3>
            <p>We pioneered these cooperative concepts and published them freely so the world could benefit. Others have since proved that our concepts work at scale—particularly in telemedicine and cooperative medication access.</p>
            <p>Now we're channeling that into something bigger: <strong>transparent, cooperative power that forces systemic change through constituent democracy.</strong></p>
            <p>This isn't about competing with Mark Cuban, ZORTT, or anyone else. It's about We the People taking back control of our government, our healthcare, our economy, and our future.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>We're not the solution. You are.</strong> We're just the organizational structure that amplifies your power to 3.5%—and beyond.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>We Are Forever Evolving</h3>
            <p>This website will evolve constantly. Not because we're confused or changing direction, but because <span style="color: #ffeb3b; font-weight: bold;">emerging threats demand that we stay ten steps ahead.</span></p>
            <p>We've spent 16 years learning to anticipate threats, pivot when necessary, and keep our eyes on the real prize: a healthcare system, economy, and government that serve people—not profit.</p>
            <p>We will continue to do that. Openly. Transparently. Accountably.</p>
            <p><strong>We are building this for you. With you. Accountable to you.</strong></p>
