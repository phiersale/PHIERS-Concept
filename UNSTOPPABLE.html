    <h1>UNSTOPPABLE: The Movement We Build Together</h1>
    <p>The signatures. The cascade. The future we choose on purpose.</p>

<section>
<h2>Why This Page Exists</h2>

<p>
UNBREAKABLE is the record of how PHIERS was built under pressure.
UNSTOPPABLE is the record of what happens next — when people move together.
</p>

<p>
This page is not about one man’s endurance.
It’s about our shared decision to turn integrity into impact,
math into momentum, and clarity into change.
</p>
</section>

<section class="dark">
<h2>The Simple Math of Power</h2>

<p>
Power in a democracy is not supposed to be mysterious.
It is supposed to be measurable.
</p>

<p>When enough of us move in the same direction, three things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Systems adjust.</li>
<li>Leaders listen.</li>
<li>Policy follows.</li>
</ul>

<p>
PHIERS gives us a way to show that movement in real time —
not as a protest, but as proof.
</p>
</section>

<h2>The First Threshold: 3.5% Before March 28</h2>

<p>
If we reach 3.5% of the country before March 28,
the No Kings Rally becomes more than a moment —
it becomes a reckoning.
</p>

<p>
At that scale, every member of Congress will have a choice to make:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Align with the clear will of their constituents, or</li>
<li>Explain publicly why they refused.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This isn’t about force.
It’s about accountability — the most American principle there is.
</p>

<p>
We are choosing organized democracy over drift toward anything resembling authoritarian rule.
</p>

<p>
The people are angry — and rightfully so.
Both parties have drifted away from the public.
Independents are rising because people want agency, not allegiance.
</p>

<p>
This movement meets people exactly where they are.
</p>
</section>

<section class="dark">
<h2>The Second Threshold: 100 Million Before July 4</h2>

<p>
If we reach 100 million people before July 4,
we do more than win a policy change.
</p>

<p>
We honor the 250th anniversary of America’s founding documents
by living up to them.
</p>

<p>
On that day, we won’t be waiting for a speech or a ceremony.
We’ll be practicing the very thing the founders wrote down:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A people who can assemble.</li>
<li>A people who can be heard.</li>
<li>A people who can correct course when their government drifts away from them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One hundred million signatures is not rebellion.
It is patriotism — peaceful, organized, undeniable.
</p>

<p>
It is a modern declaration that government of, by, and for the people
is not a slogan.
It is a standard.
</p>

<p>
On the 250th anniversary, we’re not tearing anything down.
We’re finishing what was started.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What We’re Asking For</h2>

<p>The signatures are not a protest. They are proof.</p>

<ul>
<li>Affordable telehealth added to the ACA Exchange.</li>
<li>Access extended to CMS, VA, Tri-Care, and Indian Health Service beneficiaries.</li>
<li>A system that respects time, money, and life.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are not asking for special treatment.
We are asking for a system that finally works the way it was always supposed to.
</p>
</section>

<section class="dark">
<h2>My Role and the Co-Op We’re Building</h2>

<p>
My job is not to be the face of this forever.
My job is to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Strategize</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Architect</li>
<li>Build the PHIERS framework</li>
<li>Help bring in the right people to lead it at scale</li>
</ul>

<p>
PHIERS was never meant to be held by one person.
It was designed to be handed to a democratically-led co-op built with organizations committed to defending democracy and expanding access.
</p>

<p>
The movement’s leadership belongs to the many, not the one.
</p>

<h2>The Spiritual Dimension</h2>

<p>
This work has never felt like a career move.
It has felt like a calling.
</p>

<p>
Not in a way that excludes anyone —
but in the simple human sense that some work is bigger than any one person.
</p>

<p>
You don’t have to share my beliefs to feel it.
You just have to recognize when something is clearly right —
and clearly overdue.
</p>

<h2>Why We Are, Together, Unstoppable</h2>

<p>
UNBREAKABLE proved that integrity can survive pressure.
UNSTOPPABLE proves that integrity, multiplied by millions,
can reshape what’s possible.
</p>

<p>
We are not waiting for permission.
We are not asking for a savior.
We are building, together, the future we wish someone had built for us.
</p>

<p>
PHIERS is the blueprint.
The movement is the engine.
And when enough of us move together —
in the most grounded, measurable sense of the word —
<strong>unstoppable.</strong>
